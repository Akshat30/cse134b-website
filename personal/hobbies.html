        <h2>Listening to EDM</h2>
        <p>
          One of my favorite hobbies includes listening to EDM. I am a big fan
          of genres such as house music, dubstep, and drum and bass.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since house music is my favorite genre of music, here are my top three
          favorite house artists, at the moment:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Max Styler</li>
          <li>John Summit</li>
          <li>Odd Mob</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Here is a snippet of a Max Styler song I really like, it is called
          Touch. I have it downloaded as I also DJ, and it requires me to have
          audio files downloaded for mixing.
        </p>

          Your browser does not support the audio element.
